Add to backend/config.php

// File uploader thingy
$site_config["UPLOADER"] = true; // Site uploader ON/OFF
$fileExtensionsAllowed = ['rar', 'zip']; // Allowed filetypes
$maxFileSize = 100 * 1024 * 1024; // Change the first number to desired size eg: 100 = 100MB. Cannot exceed php.ini upload_max_filesize and post_max_size setting. Its overcomplicated, i'm sorry
$uploadDirectory = "/uploadedfiles/"; // this should be obvious

Create a folder/directory to upload files into and CHMOD 755. In this config it is "uploadedfiles". You can change that obviously
Make any adjustments to the user class in uploader.php to limit access to the delete button. Default is 6
Access it by visiting yoursite.com/uploader.php or create a link wherever you want to do that
